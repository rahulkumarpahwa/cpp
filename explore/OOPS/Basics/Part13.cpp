/*
NOTE :
How Can One Object Access Another Object's Private Members?
Your confusion comes from the assumption that one object should not be able to access another object's private members. This is generally true for external functions, but not for member functions of the same class.

ðŸš€ Key Rule in C++:
âž¡ A member function of a class can access the private members of any object of the same class.
âž¡ This is because all objects of a class share the same definition of member functions, and member functions have full access to all instances of the class.
