/*
Polymorphism
Types: 1. Compile time polymorphism : here we decide that at the compile time that which fxn is going to be called.
eg. fxn overloading, operator overloading etc.
Also called as early binding.

2. RunTime polymorphism : here we will not decide at the compile time that which fxn is going to be called but at the runtime it is decided which fxn is going to be called.
eg. virtual functions etc.
also called as late binding.
